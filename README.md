This repository provides the architectural and design documentation for the Hybrid High-Performance Computing and Quantum Computing (HPCQC) Stack, currently under development as part of a research proposal. Covers the software architecture and runtime design. The documentation defines the conceptual, logical, and technical foundations of a hybrid runtime that integrates classical HPC resources with quantum backends under a unified software stack. It focuses on design rationale, interoperability between ecosystems, and formal reproducibility of hybrid workflows.

Currently, this documentation is in the proposal and design phase —no production implementation yet.
